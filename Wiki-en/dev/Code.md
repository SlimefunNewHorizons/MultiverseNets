# ⚙️ How the MultiverseNets code works

This document explains the plugin's internals: how a network is represented, where and how the
state is persisted, how items and fluids flow, and how the code is organized by layer. It is aimed
at developers who want to read or modify the code. For the player-facing behaviour of each machine
see the [wiki README](../README.md).

```

All network logic runs on the server's main thread (synchronous), avoiding race conditions with the
world. The plugin is **not Folia-compatible** for that reason. The only other thread is the node
storage I/O thread, which does nothing but read and write region files (§5.2).

## 2. Plugin lifecycle

Main class: `MultiverseNets extends JavaPlugin` (singleton via `MultiverseNets.instance()`; exposes
`networks()`, `ticker()` and `blockListener()`).

**`onEnable()`**, in order:
1. `saveDefaultConfig()`, `Keys.init(this)`, `Settings.refresh(this)`.
2. `SlimefunBridge.registerSerializationAliases()` and `SlimefunBridge.init(...)` — the Slimefun
   integration activates only if Slimefun is installed.
3. `ProtectionBridge.init(...)` — registers every protection provider whose plugin is present.
4. `Items.registerRecipes(this)`, `NodeStore.init(this)` (storage I/O thread and controller
   registry), `StorageListener`, `NodeStore.migrateLoadedChunks()` (moves the ≤ 5.2 chunk data of
   already-loaded chunks into region files) and the autosave task (`NodeStore.autosave` every
   `storage.autosave-seconds`).
5. `new NetworkManager(this); networks.load()` — recreates the networks from the saved controllers.
6. Registers `BlockListener`, `GuiListener`, `ChatPrompts` and `CraftingListener`.
7. Re-registers the recipes one tick later and again after 100 ticks (so datapack reloads cannot
   drop them) and unlocks them for online players.
8. `NetworkHologramManager.init`, a repeating task that drops the protection cache every
   `protection.cache-ticks`, then starts `NetworkTicker` and registers `/mvnets`.

**`onDisable()`**: stops the ticker and the protection task, removes every hologram, and runs
`networks.saveAll()` (controller registry), then `NodeStore.shutdown()`: writes every region with
changes and waits up to 30 s for the I/O thread.

## 3. Persistent keys (`util/Keys`)

Single registry for every `NamespacedKey` used in the `PersistentDataContainer` (PDC) of items
(and, up to 5.2, of chunks; namespace `multiversenets:`):

| Constant | Key | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DEVICE_TYPE` | `device_type` | Device type on items (`DeviceType` enum name). |
| `WIRELESS_BIND` | `wireless_bind` | Controller coordinates bound to a Wireless Terminal. |
| `RECEIVER_BIND` | `receiver_bind` | Bridge link on a Receiver or Transmitter item (`world;x;y;z` of the other end). |
| `BLUEPRINT_RECIPE` | `blueprint_recipe` | Legacy recipe key stored on an old blueprint. |
| `CHUNK_HAS_NODES` | `chunk_has_nodes` | Legacy (≤ 5.2) marker: the chunk still holds node data in its PDC. Only the migration reads it, and deletes it. |
| `TERMINAL_DISPLAY` | `terminal_display` | Terminal search/sort display settings. |
| `CELL_CARGO` | `cell_cargo` | Serialized (Base64) `NodeBlob` embedded in a broken device's item. |
| `BLUEPRINT_DATA` | `blueprint_data` | `RecipeData` encoded in Base64 on a Blueprint. |
| `CONFIG_DATA` | `config_data` | Wrench: copied materials plus `WL:`/`BL:` mode. |
| `CONFIG_ITEMS` | `config_items` | Wrench: exact filter templates (encoded `NodeBlob` carrying `filterItems`). |
| `RAKE_USES` | `rake_uses` | Remaining uses of the Network Rake. |
| `SF_BLUEPRINT` | `sf_blueprint` | Marks a Blueprint encoded from a Slimefun recipe. |

## 4. Coordinates (`util/PosUtil`)

A 3D block position is packed into a **single 64-bit `long`**:

- **X → 26 bits** (bits 38–63), mask `0x3FFFFFF`, range ±33,554,431.
- **Z → 26 bits** (bits 12–37), same range.
- **Y → 12 bits** (bits 0–11), range −2048 … +2047.

`pack(x, y, z) = (x & 0x3FFFFFF) << 38 | (z & 0x3FFFFFF) << 12 | (y & 0xFFF)`. Negatives are handled
by arithmetic shifts in `unpack`. Packed positions are the keys of `Network.nodes` and locate chunks
(`PosUtil.unpackX(pos) >> 4`). `PosUtilTest` pins the format.

## 5. Persistence (`persist/NodeBlob` and `persist/NodeStore`)

### 5.1 Node state: `NodeBlob`
`Serializable` (UID fixed at `1L`, so new fields deserialize as defaults on old blobs) with public
fields:

| Field | Type | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `typeName` | `String` | Every node (`DeviceType` name). |
| `cellSample` / `cellAmount` | `ItemStack` / `long` | Quantum Cells and Infinity Barrel (the barrel keeps `cellSample` when empty). |
| `filterMaterials` / `filterItems` / `filterBlacklist` | `List<String>` / `List<ItemStack>` / `boolean` | Filterable devices. `filterItems` (exact templates) wins over `filterMaterials` when non-empty. |
| `targetFace` | `String` | Advanced Grabber/Pusher face (`NORTH`… or `ALL`). |
| `transitBuffer` / `transitAmount` | `ItemStack` / `long` | Grabbers and Pushers: items waiting because neither the network nor the source took them. The `ItemStack` is a 1-unit sample and the quantity lives in `transitAmount`, because Paper cannot serialize an `ItemStack` above 99 (a buffer can hold 1,024). Always use `transitStack()` / `setTransit()` / `addTransit()`. |
| `recipes` / `blueprintData` | `List<String>` | Crafters: legacy recipe keys / installed `RecipeData` (Base64). |
| `craftingMatrix` | `ItemStack[9]` | Encoder and Crafting Grid template. |
| `encoderBlank` / `encoderOutput` | `ItemStack` | Blueprints left in the Recipe Encoder's slots. |
| `txWorld` / `txX` / `txY` / `txZ` | `String` / `int` | Bridge link of a Receiver or Transmitter (the other end). |
| `greedySamples` / `greedyAmounts` | `List<ItemStack>` / `List<Long>` | Greedy Cell multi-item buffer. |
| `virtualCacheTier` / `virtualSamples` / `virtualAmounts` | `int` / lists | Item memory module stock: a DRAM Bay with an item module, or a legacy Controller cache. |
| `recoveredModules` | `List<ItemStack>` | Controller only: modules that were inside it before the DRAM Bay, taken out by `Network.scan()` (`MemoryModules.migrateControllerCache`) with their stock; the Terminal lists them first and hands them out; breaking the controller drops them. |
| `bayModules` / `installedModule` | `List<NodeBlob>` / `String` | DRAM Bay: up to 18 installed modules, one blob each (module type in `typeName`, stock in `virtualSamples`/`virtualAmounts` + `virtualCacheTier`, or `dramFluids`/`dramFluidAmounts`). `installedModule` is the legacy single-module field; `migrateSingleModuleBay()` (called by `NodeStore.normalize` and `MemoryModules.modules`) moves it into the list. |
| `dramFluids` / `dramFluidAmounts` | `List<String>` / `List<Long>` | A Fluid DRAM Module (inside a DRAM Bay's `bayModules`): several fluids (mB). |
| `chickenActive` / `chickenPull` / `chickenProducts` / `chickenMinTier` / `chickenMaxTier` / `chickenKnown` / `chickenAge` / `chickenMinStrength` / `chickenPureOnly` | various | Genetic Chicken Sorter rules (see §19). |
| `quotaSample` / `quotaLimit` / `quotaActive` | `ItemStack` / `long` / `boolean` | Quota Limiter. |
| `fluidType` / `fluidAmount` | `String` / `long` | Quantum Fluid Cell (mB). |
| `pumpFluid` (`pumpMode` legacy) | `String` | Liquid Pump filter (`WATER`, `LAVA`, null = any). |
| `ownerUuid` | `String` | Controller only: the network's owner. |
| `crayon` | `boolean` | Legacy field, unused. |

### 5.2 Node storage: `NodeStore` and region files
Nothing is stored in the chunk. Every node lives in a **region file inside the world folder**:
`<world>/multiversenets/r.<rx>.<rz>.mvn`, 32×32 chunks per file (when the server does not expose the
folder: `<dataFolder>/nodes/<world-uuid>/`). Every class is package-private except the facade:

| Class | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `NodeStore` | Public facade (the API the plugin always used) and controller registry. Main thread only. |
| `WorldNodes` | One world: which regions exist on disk (listed once), which are in memory and which are being read in the background. `region(cx, cz, create)`, `prefetch`, `flush`, `evictIdle`. |
| `NodeRegion` | The nodes of one region keyed by packed position, plus per-chunk counters (`total`, `ticking`) so `countNodesInChunk`, `countTickingInChunk` and `chunkHasNodes` are O(1). `dirty` flag and `writesInFlight`. |
| `NodeRecord` | One node: type name, encoded blob (`null` = the default blob of that type) and the shared decoded instance (`live`). Replaced wholesale on every write. |
| `RegionFile` | Binary format: magic `MVNR`, version, rx/rz, type table, then per node `x y z typeIndex length bytes`, and a CRC32 at the end. Blobs are already gzip-compressed, so the file is not compressed again; a cable costs 20 bytes. |
| `NodeIO` | The single I/O thread (`MultiverseNets-NodeIO`). One thread so reads and writes of a file run in queue order. Writes go to `.tmp` and replace the file with an atomic move; an unreadable file is renamed `.corrupt-<time>` and the region starts empty. After shutdown, late work runs on the caller. |
| `LegacyChunkData` | Reads and deletes the ≤ 5.2 chunk PDC entries (`n<x>_<y>_<z>` blob, `t<x>_<y>_<z>` type, `chunk_has_nodes` marker). |

**Life of a region.** On `ChunkLoadEvent` (`StorageListener`, priority LOWEST) a chunk that carries
the legacy marker is migrated; any other chunk starts reading its region in the background
(`prefetch`). The first lookup joins that read; a region nobody prefetched is read on demand through
the same I/O thread, which keeps the order with any queued write. `NodeStore.autosave()` (every
`storage.autosave-seconds`) serializes the dirty regions on the main thread — it only copies bytes —
and queues the writes; a region left empty deletes its file. Then `evictIdle` drops every region that
is saved, has no write in flight and has no loaded chunk with nodes. `WorldSaveEvent` saves that
world, `WorldUnloadEvent` saves and forgets it, and `onDisable` saves everything and waits.

**Default blobs.** `put` encodes the blob as before and compares it with the encoding of
`NodeBlob.create(type)` (cached per type). When they are equal only the type is stored, and `get`
builds a fresh default blob. Every cable and every device nobody configured costs a type and a
position.

API for the rest of the plugin (unchanged): `put` / `get` (copy-on-read; null if the chunk is not
loaded) / `canonical` / `getType` / `hasNode` / `remove` / `countNodesInChunk` /
`countTickingInChunk` / `chunkHasNodes` / `encode` / `decode`. Lifecycle: `init`, `shutdown`,
`autosave`, `flush(World)`, `flushAll(wait)`, `onChunkLoad`, `onWorldUnload`, `migrateLoadedChunks`,
`migrateLegacy(Chunk)` and `stats()`.
- **`put`** loads the block's chunk when it is not loaded (the old `block.getChunk()` did the same),
  so a node just written is never read back as missing. It throws `IllegalStateException` when the
  blob cannot be serialized, as before.
- **`canonical(Block)`** returns the shared, already-decoded instance kept in the node's record.
  `NetworkStorage` reads every cell on every deposit and withdrawal, and decoding there was the
  plugin's heaviest cost. Every `put` replaces the record and makes the caller's object the live
  instance, so it is never older than the last write (`NodeStoreCanonicalTest`); it goes away with
  its region.
- **`decode`** treats a corrupt entry as missing, silently and cheaply (`NodeStoreCorruptionTest`);
  it also migrates legacy blobs (null lists, single-item Greedy Cells).
- **No per-chunk limit.** The only density control is the optional
  `network.max-active-devices-per-chunk`, checked on `BlockPlaceEvent` with `countTickingInChunk`
  for devices whose `DeviceType.isTicking()` is true (`NodeStoreRegionTest`).

### 5.3 Controller registry (`networks.yml`)
`Map<UUID, List<String>>` (world → `"x,y,z"`) persisted to `<dataFolder>/networks.yml`. `save()`
writes asynchronously when called from the main thread. `NetworkManager.load()` rebuilds the
networks from it at startup.

## 6. The network (`net/Network` and `net/NetworkManager`)

### 6.1 Topology: `Network`
- Identified by the packed controller position. `nodes: Map<Long, DeviceType>` plus the reverse index
  `byType: Map<DeviceType, Set<Long>>`, so the ticker only iterates the types it needs.
- `scan()` — **BFS** from the controller over the 6 axis-aligned neighbours. It:
  - never loads chunks (unloaded neighbours are skipped; an unloaded controller leaves the network
    untouched);
  - classifies each neighbour with one in-memory lookup (`NodeStore.getType`): no chunk object, no
    decoding, the same cost in a dense chunk as in an empty one;
  - clears the network if the controller block no longer has a blob (`controller missing`);
  - takes the owner from the controller blob and refuses to expand into land that owner cannot use
    (`ProtectionBridge.mayActorUse`), counting the refusals (`linksBlockedByProtection()`);
  - stops at another controller (`foreign controller at x,y,z`) and sets
    `touchesForeignController()`;
  - with Slimefun, treats Slimefun blocks whose id contains `CABLE`/`BRIDGE` as cables and records
    touching Slimefun barrels (`slimefunBarrels()`);
  - honours `network.max-nodes`; bumps `version` and invalidates the storage cache.
- Queries: `contains`, `typeAt`, `forEach(type, consumer)` (defensive copy), `count(type)`, `block(pos)`,
  `ownerUuid()`, `error`.

### 6.2 Manager: `NetworkManager`
- `networksByWorld: Map<UUID, Map<Long, Network>>`.
- `registerController` / `removeController`, `networkAt(Block)` (linear search of the world's
  networks), `networkByController(Location)`.
- `invalidateNear(Block)` — rescans the block's network and its 6 neighbours' (place/break/rake).
- Filter helpers: `filterPredicate(blob)` (empty filter → accepts everything; otherwise whitelist or
  blacklist), `matchesFilter(template, item)` (order: DeviceType → Slimefun id → display name →
  material), `extractMatching(Inventory, …)` (one item type, merging every slot up to the quota;
  only the result slot of a furnace), `insertInto(Inventory, …)` (in chunks of one stack, so a slot
  never receives more than the item allows) and `insertSmart(inv, sample, amount, face, kinds)` (the
  Pusher's insertion: one stack per slot, furnace input/fuel by face and never the result slot, and
  with `kinds > 1` each whitelist entry takes at most `slots / kinds` slots).

## 7. Item storage: `NetworkStorage`

One "vault" over every storage of the network: the **memory modules** (every item module in every DRAM
Bay, up to 18 per bay, plus a legacy module inside the Controller; each one is saved through the bay
that contains it), **Quantum Cells**, **Infinity Barrels**,
**Greedy Cells** and **Slimefun barrels**. All methods are
`synchronized`; blobs are read with `NodeStore.canonical` and only dirty ones are written back.

- **`deposit(ItemStack)` → leftover**. First the **Quota Limiters** cap the amount (lowest limit wins),
  then 8 passes: (1) Greedy Cells whose filter matches or that already hold the item → (2) memory
  modules holding that type → (3) Slimefun barrels holding it → (4) cells/barrels holding it → (5)
  memory module free space → (6) empty Slimefun barrels → (7) empty cells/barrels (they adopt the
  type) → (8) Greedy Cells without a filter. Never mutates the argument.
- **`withdraw(matcher, want, excludePos, includeGreedy)`** — memory modules → cells and barrels →
  Slimefun barrels → Greedy Cells (only if `includeGreedy`). Returns a single item type. Greedy
  suction and both bridge directions pass `includeGreedy = false`; Pushers, terminals, crafting and the
  API include Greedy Cells. A Greedy Cell never gives its last unit of an item defined in its filter
  (`greedyReserve`). `releasedByPushers(item)` is true when a Pusher whitelists the item: deposits then
  skip Greedy Cells, Greedy suction ignores it and `NetworkTicker.releaseToPushers` moves the Greedy
  Cell's whole stock of it (reserve included) to the other storages. An Infinity Barrel keeps its `cellSample` when it
  reaches 0; a cell forgets it.
- `breakdown(item)` — one pass returning where an item is kept (memory, cells, barrels, Greedy,
  Slimefun barrels); the Terminal lists it under the total.
- `count`, `remainingQuota`, `view()` (500 ms cache, merged with `StackUtils.itemsMatch`),
  `getPurgedItemsView`, `isItemPurged`, counters.

## 8. Fluid storage: `NetworkFluidStorage`

Separate from items: the sum of every `MVN_FLUID_CELL` (one fluid per cell, `fluids.cell-capacity-mb`
each) and every DRAM Bay holding a Fluid DRAM Module (several fluids, `fluids.dram-capacity-mb` in
total). Deposit order: cells holding that fluid → Fluid DRAMs → empty cells. `deposit(fluid, mB)` is **all-or-nothing**: it returns `0` if everything fit and the full
amount (storing nothing) otherwise, because every caller — pump, terminal, input slot — consumes a
whole bucket, bottle or source block only on `0`. `withdraw`, `count`, `getFluids`, `totalCapacity`,
`totalStored`.

## 9. The heartbeat: `NetworkTicker`

- `runTaskTimer(plugin, run, 20L, 5L)`; per-family countdowns (`scanIn`, `transferIn`, `vacuumIn`,
  `craftIn`) fire each family at its configured interval.
- Each run: networks are sorted by world and controller position; dirty or due networks are
  scanned; if any operation is due, `assignSharedNodes` gives every node shared by two networks
  (`touchesForeignController`) to the first one, so **each device works once per cycle**; then
  transfers, vacuum and crafting run through `forEachWorked`; finally the hologram is updated inside
  a try/catch (a hologram failure is logged once and never stops the loop).
- **`doTransfers`** (`items-per-op` = 128, HT = ×`ht-multiplier`):
  - **Grabber** (`grabOnce`): retries its transit buffer first; then the first face that yields a
    match — Slimefun machine output slots first, then vanilla containers. Overflow → Pushers that
    accept it (`streamToPushers`) → transit buffer. It is never handed back to the source:
    `SlimefunBridge.insert` uses the INPUT slots and the product was processed again. Idle grabbers back off
    (only every third cycle after an empty one, up to 30).
  - **Pusher** (`pushOnce`): retries its transit buffer first; empty whitelist = idle; targets are
    the faces from `facesFor` holding a container or Slimefun machine that is not a network node
    (`isPushTarget`). A whitelist of several entries gives one predicate per entry, rotating the first
    one every cycle (`pushPredicates`); any other filter tries up to 4 distinct types. Each
    withdrawal (no Greedy) is inserted with `insertToTarget` → `insertSmart` / `SlimefunBridge.insert(…,
    kinds)`; the rest goes back to the network or into the transit buffer (`returnToNetwork`).
  - **Genetic Chicken Sorter** (`chickenSortOnce`): only when `chickenActive`; push or pull up to 16
    chickens that pass `ChickenGenetics.matches`.
  - **Greedy Cell** (`greedyTick`): suction up to `4 × items-per-op`, distribution up to
    `2 × items-per-op` into adjacent non-network containers.
  - **Purger**: only with a non-empty filter.
  - **Receiver** (`bridgeOnce`) / **Transmitter** (`transmitOnce`): the end that holds the link
    moves items across. Filter rule `bridgeFilterSet`: non-empty whitelist or any blacklist. Both
    ends pass the protection check with their own network's owner; leftovers go back to the source
    and, failing that, drop next to the device.
  - **Liquid Pump** (`pumpTick`): one source block below, only if `deposit` returns 0.
- **`doVacuum`**: dropped `Item` entities without pickup delay within `vacuum.radius`.
- **`doCrafting`**: every Auto-Crafter (and Slimefun Auto-Crafter if `Settings.sfCrafterEnabled()`) tries each
  installed Blueprint once.
- Every block touched passes `denied(net, block)` → `ProtectionBridge.mayActorUse(block, owner)`.

## 10. Devices and items (`item/DeviceType`, `item/Items`)

`DeviceType` enumerates the **46** devices, modules and tools; each constant has `material`,
`display`, `placeable` and `cellTier`. Derived properties: `isCell()`, `isBarrel()`, `isFluidCell()`,
`isLiquidPump()`, `isRequestTerminal()`, `isAutoCrafter()`, `isRequestCrafter()`,
`isSlimefunCrafter()`, `filterable()` (grabbers, pushers, vacuum, greedy cell, purger, receiver,
transmitter), `isImporter()`/`isExporter()`, `isDirectional()`, `isRouter()`, `isCacheModule()`,
`isMemoryModule()` (cache modules + Fluid DRAM), `isTicking()` (devices the ticker works every cycle;
what `network.max-active-devices-per-chunk` counts), `cacheTier()`. `parse(name)` accepts `MVN_…`, the unprefixed form and `wireless`.

`Items`:
- `create(type)` builds the item (name, lore, `DEVICE_TYPE`); `typeOf(item)` reads it back.
- `capacityOf(type)` — cells, barrel, greedy cell and cache modules from `Settings`.
- Tools: `rake()`/`rakeUses`/`spendRakeUse`; `saveConfig`/`readConfig` and
  `saveConfigItems`/`readConfigItems` (wrench); `linkReceiver`/`readReceiverBind` (bridge link,
  used for both Receiver and Transmitter items); `bindWireless`/`readWirelessBind`.
- `registerRecipes(plugin)` — the **46** shaped recipes (43 always, plus the Slimefun encoder and the
  two Slimefun crafters while their `enabled` flags are on). Patterns: [Recipes.md](../Recipes.md).
  A device used as an ingredient is registered with `device(recipe, char, type)`: a plain
  `MaterialChoice` of the device's material plus an entry in `deviceIngredients(key)` (type → count).
  `isUpgradeRecipe(key)` marks the cell and module tier upgrades.
- `GuideContent` holds the in-game guide text in English and Spanish: one entry per device (Spanish
  name, what it does, how to use it), its category, and the general topics. Recipes are not written
  there: `GuideMenu` reads them from the registered recipes (`Items.deviceIngredientAt(key, char)`
  tells which grid letters are devices).

## 11. Crafting (`craft/Blueprints` and `craft/CraftingSupport`)

- `RecipeData` — `inputs[9]` (quantity 1, `null` = empty) and `output`. `Blueprints.encode/decode`
  (Java serialization + Base64), `toItem`, `read`, `isBlueprint`.
- `Blueprints.resolve(matrix, world)` resolves the matrix against the server's vanilla recipes
  (cached); `matchesOutput` requires that recipe to still yield the recorded output, so **if the server
  changes the recipe, the blueprint stops working**.
- `CraftingSupport.tryCraftBlueprint(net, data)` — **all-or-nothing**:
  1. Resolve the result (vanilla recipe; with Slimefun, the Slimefun recipe; the recorded output is
     trusted only for Slimefun items).
  2. Aggregate needs by item, pre-check with `count`, then `withdraw` each one; a failure midway
     returns everything taken (`returnOrDrop`: deposits back and drops **only** what did not fit next
     to the controller).
  3. Deposit the result. If it only partly fits, the stored part is withdrawn again and the
     ingredients are returned — the craft either happens whole or not at all.
- `tryCraftOnce` / `tryCraftAll` — legacy recipe-key variant with the same rollback.
- `RequestTerminalMenu` plans chains with a simulated stock (`planCraft`), executes step by step with
  an intermediate buffer, and returns any intermediate leftovers to the network.

## 12. GUI layer (`gui/`)

### 12.1 Base: `MenuHolder`
Abstract `InventoryHolder`. `open(size, title)` creates the inventory, calls `draw()` and opens it;
`refresh()` redraws keeping the `vanillaSlots()` contents. Helpers: `giveOrDrop`,
`playerInventorySlot(event)`. Each menu implements `draw()` and `click(event)`; `onClose` is optional.

| Menu | Size | Usage / details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TerminalMenu` | 54 | Terminal (block, wireless, transmitter/receiver buttons). Input `INPUT_SLOT=8`, purger view `17`, sort `26`, fluids page `35`, pages `44`/`53`; 48 items per page. Fluid deposits/withdrawals with buckets and bottles. |
| `ControllerMenu` | 27 | Controller status, router status; slot `11` shows the network memory: DRAM Bays and modules installed out of 18 per bay. |
| `DramBayMenu` | 54 | Header row: summary `4` (modules x/18, items and fluids), help `8`. Module slots `9–26` (`MODULE_SLOTS`, one per module, with a fill bar and glint while it holds something; click a module to take it out with its stock; click a free slot with a module on the cursor, or shift-click one, to install). Item gauge row `27–35` and fluid gauge row `36–44` (lit in proportion to the fill, yellow from 70 %, red from 90 %). Footer: close `49`. No eject button. Reads the blob on every click, so two viewers cannot take out the same module. |
| `ChickenSorterMenu` | 54 | Control bar: running `1`, push/pull `3`, summary book `4`, side `5`, help `7`. Products `9–26` (each shows its own item). Divider `27–35`. Gene rules: min/max tier `37`/`38`, strength `40`, pure `41`, DNA `43`, age `44` — value in the name and the stack size, glint while active, left +1, right −1, shift resets, the tier range is kept valid. Actions: clear products `46`, reset rules `49`, close `52`. |
| `MonitorMenu` | 27 | Live diagnostics (refresh task while open). |
| `FilterMenu` | 27 | Grabbers, pushers, vacuum, purger, greedy cell, receiver and transmitter: up to 17 templates, mode `17`, clear `25`, help `26`. Slot `24`: face selector for Advanced devices, "open adjacent block" for simple ones, "open terminal" for Transmitter/Receiver. |
| `CellMenu` / `BarrelMenu` | 18 | Template `4`, deposit all `11`, set item `13`, extract all `15`. The barrel's *Set Item* right-click clears the registration when empty. |
| `GreedyMenu` | 54 | 36 storage slots with pages, filter `45`, deposit `46`, monitor `49`, direction `50`, info `53`. |
| `CrafterMenu` | 27 | Auto/Request/Slimefun crafters: up to 18 Blueprints, status `24`, clear all `25` (returns them), help `26`. Installing consumes the Blueprint; uninstalling or replacing returns it. |
| `EncoderMenu` / `SfEncoderMenu` | 45 | Template grid, blueprint slot `19`, encode `16`, preview `25`, output `34`. Both encoders store Blueprints left in `19`/`34` in the block; while a menu is open they live only in that menu. |
| `CraftingGridMenu` | 54 | Network crafting: result `31`, craft one `33`, craft all `35`, clear `38`, pages `27`/`29`, info `41`. |
| `RequestTerminalMenu` | 54 | 45 options per page, delivery toggle `49`, refresh `51`, pages `45`/`53`. |
| `QuotaLimiterMenu` | 36 | Target item `13`, on/off `22`, chat limit `31`, ±1/10/64/1,000 buttons. |
| `FluidCellMenu` | 27 | Tank `13`, bucket interaction `10`, extract one bucket `15`, void tank `16` (shift+right-click). |
| `LiquidPumpMenu` | 27 | Fluid filter `12` (ANY/WATER/LAVA), network fluids `14`. |
| `QuantumWorkbenchMenu` | 45 | Cell upgrade: centre `20`, craft `23`, output `25`; ingredients returned on close. |
| `GuideMenu` | 54 | `/mvnets guide`: home (topics `19`, categories `21–25`, `30–32`), topics, category list, device page (recipe grid `10-12/19-21/28-30`, result `24`, what `15`, how `16`, numbers `33`, ingredients `34`, previous/next `48`/`50`, back `45`, home `49`); language toggle `53` keeps the page. Pages reopen one tick later. |
| `ChatPrompts` | — | Chat-driven numeric prompts (request terminal, limiter). |

### 12.2 Security: `GuiListener` (dupe guard)
For every `MenuHolder` top inventory: cancels double-click, middle click, number keys, offhand swap,
drops, creative actions, `COLLECT_TO_CURSOR`, hotbar moves and `UNKNOWN`; only shift-clicks from the
player inventory reach the menu; non-vanilla top slots are cancelled and forwarded to `click`; drags
over non-vanilla slots are cancelled; `onClose` is forwarded.

## 13. Events (`listen/`)

`BlockListener` owns the event wiring; `DeviceInteractions` decides what each device opens and the
player access gate (`canAccessNetwork`, static: admin bypass, protection providers, BentoBox island
membership), installs memory modules in a DRAM Bay and handles the fluid-cell quick interaction.

| Event | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `BlockPlaceEvent` | Blocked worlds checked, then the optional `max-active-devices-per-chunk` cap (ticking devices only; there is no other per-chunk limit); registers the node, restores the embedded state (`CELL_CARGO`), applies a bridge link from the item (Receiver or Transmitter), records the Controller's owner, then registers the controller or rescans the neighbours. |
| `BlockBreakEvent` | Drops the Encoder's stored Blueprints and every module of a DRAM Bay (with its stock, also in creative), drops the device with its state embedded (nothing in creative), removes the node and rescans. |
| `PlayerInteractEvent` | Air click with a Wireless Terminal (combat lock, range/world unless Router, access check). Block click: access check, then Probe, Rake (returns the device), Wrench, bindings (wireless on controller/terminal; Receiver item on Transmitter and Transmitter item on Receiver), sneaking never opens menus, cable status message, a module on a Controller only shows a hint, module install on an empty DRAM Bay, fluid cell quick interact, device menu. |
| `InventoryMoveItemEvent` | Cancelled whenever the source or the destination is a network node, without touching either inventory. Hoppers never interact with the plugin; the old Infinity Barrel path called `removeItem` while Paper had shrunk the hopper slot to the moved amount, which deleted the whole stack. |
| Pistons / explosions | Nodes cannot be moved and are removed from explosion block lists. |
| `EntityDamageByEntityEvent` | Records combat time for the Wireless Terminal lock. |
| `ChunkLoadEvent` (`StorageListener`) | Migrates the chunk's ≤ 5.2 PDC data, or starts reading its node region in the background. |
| `WorldSaveEvent` / `WorldUnloadEvent` (`StorageListener`) | Saves that world's node regions (so `/save-all` saves networks too); on unload it also forgets them. |

`CraftingListener` re-registers recipes after reloads and unlocks them on join. On
`PrepareItemCraftEvent` it only acts when the server matched a recipe: for this plugin's recipes the
devices in the grid must equal `Items.deviceIngredients(key)` exactly; a device that carries
`CELL_CARGO` is only accepted by an upgrade recipe, whose result receives that cargo; any other
recipe with a device in the grid gets a null result.

## 14. Command `/mvnets` (`command/MvnetsCommand`)

Subcommands: `help`, `guide` (open) and `give <id> [n]`, `doctor`, `stats`,
`inspect`, `repair`, `recipes`, `save`, `reload` (**`multiversenets.admin`**). `stats` also prints
the node storage numbers (`NodeStore.stats()`); `save` queues a write of every region with changes.
The tab completer completes
subcommands, `en|es` for `guide` (it opens `GuideMenu`), and device ids for `give` (`type.id()`, e.g. `mvn_controller`;
`give` also accepts the unprefixed form).

## 15. Public API (`api/MultiverseNetsAPI`)

Static, null-safe methods for other plugins, all keyed by any block of a network:
`isNetworkBlock(block)`, `extract(block, matcher, amount)`, `insert(block, stack)` (returns the
leftover) and `count(block, matcher)`. They go straight to `NetworkStorage`, so quotas and storage
order apply.

## 16. Slimefun integration (`compat/SlimefunBridge`)

- Slimefun machines keep their inventory in a `BlockMenu`, not an `InventoryHolder`; without the bridge
  they look like decorative blocks.
- **Reflection only** — probes `com.github.drakescraft_labs.slimefun4.legacy` and
  `io.github.thebusybiscuit.slimefun4.legacy`. With `compat.slimefun: false` or no Slimefun it stays
  dormant (`isAvailable()` = false).
- API: `isMachine`, `getId(Block)` / `getId(ItemStack)`, `extract` (output slots +
  `WITHDRAW`), `insert` (input slots + `INSERT`), `isNetworkCable`, `isBarrel` and barrel
  deposit/withdraw, `findSlimefunRecipe`, `openSlimefunMenu`. Spanish legacy aliases remain
  (`disponible`, `esMaquina`, `idDe`, `esItemSlimefun`, `extraer`, `insertar`).

## 17. Land protection (`compat/ProtectionBridge`)

- **Why**: a network is an anonymous actor; without this, a grabber in public land could read a chest
  inside somebody's region.
- **Owner**: the Controller stores its placer's UUID (`ownerUuid`); `mayActorUse(location, owner)`
  allows the network inside that owner's land. A provider certifies ownership through the optional
  `allowsActor(UUID, Location)` (implemented by ProtectionStones); the others return `null`, keeping
  their claims closed to every network. A throwing provider never grants access.
- **Legacy controllers** without an owner adopt the first player `mayPlayerAccess` allows
  (`DeviceInteractions.adoptControllerOwner`).
- **Where it applies**: `Network.scan()` (the BFS stops at land the owner cannot use and counts the
  cut), and `NetworkTicker` before every block it touches — grabbers, pushers, overflow to pushers,
  greedy distribution, vacuum, pump and both ends of the bridge in either direction. Players opening
  devices go through `canAccessNetwork`, including the remote terminal button of a Receiver.
- **Providers** (one file each, registered only if their plugin and API resolve):
  `ProtectionStonesProvider` (`PSRegion.fromLocationUnsafe`), `WorldGuardProvider`, `LandsProvider`,
  `TownyProvider`, `GriefPreventionProvider`. Methods are bound by exact signature, and only region
  containment is checked, never flags.
- **ProtectionStones caveat**: its API cannot tell a claim from a server region, so
  `protection.allow-claims` does not apply to it.
- **Performance**: answers are memoised per world and position (and per owner for `ownsAt`) and dropped
  every `protection.cache-ticks`.
- **Escape hatches**: `protection.exempt-worlds`, `protection.exempt-locations`
  (`world;x;y;z;radius`, radius 16 by default), `protection.block-network-linking: false`, and the
  `multiversenets.protection.bypass` permission for players.

## 18. Configuration (`util/Settings`)

All reads go through `Settings` over `plugin.getConfig()` (refreshed in `onEnable` and
`/mvnets reload`).

268435456, 2000000000]`. Missing or empty key → `65536 × 2^(tier−1)`; an undeclared tier clamps to the
last one with a one-time warning (`SettingsCellCapacityTest`).

## 19. GeneticChickengineering (`compat/ChickenGenetics`)

Reads pocket chickens straight from their PDC, with no dependency on the addon:
`geneticchickengineering:gce_pocket_chicken_dna` (`int[7]`: six gene states 0 = aa, 1 = Aa, 3 = AA,
plus "known"), `gce_pocket_chicken_adapter` (JSON, `baby`) and `gce_expanded_species` (special
species, tier 7-9). `read(item)` returns product (`TYPE:<typing>` or `SPECIES:<id>`), tier
(recessive genes), DNA strength (`6 − recessive − mixed`), pure, known and adult, mirroring the
addon's `PocketChickenData`. `matches(blob, item)` applies the sorter's rules (all must pass; defaults
accept every chicken, non-chickens never pass). `productId(key)` and `productTier(key)` give the raw
id and the tier of a product key; the menu uses them for each product's icon and lore.

## 20. Item matching (`util/StackUtils`)

`itemsMatch(a, b)` is a strict comparison (material, meta class, subtype data, custom model data,
PDC, enchantments, flags, lore, name) with one fallback for items that carry plugin data: two items
with the same non-empty PDC, enchantments and damage whose name and lore read the same as plain text
are the same item. That is what lets an Infinity Barrel take back a Slimefun item whose name was
stored as a different component structure. `pdcMatches` compares every primitive and array tag type
and nested containers; a tag type it cannot compare counts as different (it used to count as equal,
which merged pocket chickens with different DNA).
